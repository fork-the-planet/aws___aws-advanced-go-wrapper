## [2.0.0] - 2026-04-06
### :boom: Breaking Changes

> [!WARNING]\
> 2.0 removes the suggested ClusterId functionality ([PR #355](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-go-wrapper/pull/355)).
> #### Suggested ClusterId Functionality
> Prior to this change, the wrapper would generate a unique cluster ID based on the connection string and the cluster topology; however, in some cases (such as custom endpoints, IP addresses, and CNAME aliases, etc), the wrapper would generate an incorrect identifier. Removing the suggested cluster id functionality was needed to prevent applications with several clusters from relying on incorrect topology during failover and possibly failing to complete failover successfully.
> #### Migration
> | Number of Database Clusters in Use | Requires Changes | Action Items                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
> |------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
> | Single database cluster            | No               | No changes required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
> | Multiple database clusters         | Yes              | Review all connection strings and add mandatory `clusterId` parameter. See [Cluster ID documentation](https://github.com/aws/aws-advanced-go-wrapper/blob/main/docs/user-guide/ClusterId.md) for configuration details |

> [!WARNING]\
> 2.0.0 changes the `ConnectionPluginFactory.GetInstance` method signature.
> #### ConnectionPluginFactory.GetInstance Signature Change
> The `ConnectionPluginFactory.GetInstance(PluginService, *RWMap)` method has been replaced with `ConnectionPluginFactory.GetInstance(ServicesContainer, *RWMap)`.
> The `ServicesContainer` provides access to the `PluginService` via `servicesContainer.GetPluginService()`, as well as other services.
> If you have created custom `ConnectionPluginFactory` implementations, update them as shown below.
> #### Migration
> ```go
> // Before
> func (f MyPluginFactory) GetInstance(pluginService driver_infrastructure.PluginService, props *utils.RWMap[string, string]) (driver_infrastructure.ConnectionPlugin, error) {
>     return NewMyPlugin(pluginService, props)
> }
>
> // After
> func (f MyPluginFactory) GetInstance(servicesContainer driver_infrastructure.ServicesContainer, props *utils.RWMap[string, string]) (driver_infrastructure.ConnectionPlugin, error) {
>     return NewMyPlugin(servicesContainer.GetPluginService(), props)
> }
> ```
