## Amazon Web Services (AWS) Advanced Go Wrapper

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-Apache%202.0-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

The wrapper is complementary to existing Go drivers and aims to extend the functionality of those drivers to enable applications to take full advantage of the features of clustered databases such as Amazon Aurora. In other words, the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper does not connect directly to any database, but enables support of AWS and Aurora functionalities on top of an underlying Go driver of the user's choice. The AWS Advanced Go Wrapper has been validated to support the [pgx - PostgreSQL Driver and Toolkit](https://github.com/jackc/pgx) and the [Go-MySQL-Driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).

## About the Wrapper

Hosting a database cluster in the cloud via Aurora is able to provide users with sets of features and configurations to obtain maximum performance and availability, such as database failover. However, at the moment, most existing drivers do not currently support those functionalities or are not able to entirely take advantage of it.

The main idea behind the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper is to add a software layer on top of an existing Go driver that would enable all the enhancements brought by Aurora, without requiring users to change their workflow with their databases and existing Go drivers.

### What is Failover?

In an Amazon Aurora database cluster, **failover** is a mechanism by which Aurora automatically repairs the cluster status when a primary DB instance becomes unavailable. It achieves this goal by electing an Aurora Replica to become the new primary DB instance, so that the DB cluster can provide maximum availability to a primary read-write DB instance. The AWS Advanced Go Wrapper is designed to understand the situation and coordinate with the cluster in order to provide minimal downtime and allow connections to be very quickly restored in the event of a DB instance failure.

### Benefits of the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper

Although Aurora is able to provide maximum availability through the use of failover, existing client drivers do not currently support this functionality. This is partially due to the time required for the DNS of the new primary DB instance to be fully resolved in order to properly direct the connection. The AWS Advanced Go Wrapper allows customers to continue using their existing community drivers in addition to having the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper fully exploit failover behavior by maintaining a cache of the Aurora cluster topology and each DB instance's role (Aurora Replica or primary DB instance). This topology is provided via a direct query to the Aurora DB, essentially providing a shortcut to bypass the delays caused by DNS resolution. With this knowledge, the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper can more closely monitor the Aurora DB cluster status so that a connection to the new primary DB instance can be established as fast as possible.

### Enhanced Failure Monitoring

Since a database failover is usually identified by reaching a network or a connection timeout, the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper introduces an enhanced and customizable manner to faster identify a database outage.

Enhanced Failure Monitoring (EFM) is a feature available from the [Host Monitoring Connection Plugin](docs/user-guide/using-plugins/UsingTheHostMonitoringPlugin.md#enhanced-failure-monitoring) that periodically checks the connected database instance's health and availability. If a database instance is determined to be unhealthy, the connection is aborted (and potentially routed to another healthy instance in the cluster).

### Using the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper with plain RDS databases

The AWS Advanced Go Wrapper also works with RDS provided databases that are not Aurora.

## Getting Started

For more information on how to download the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper, minimum requirements to use it,
and how to integrate it within your project and with your Go driver of choice, please visit the
[Getting Started page](./docs/GettingStarted.md).

## Documentation

Technical documentation regarding the functionality of the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper will be maintained in this GitHub repository. Since the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper requires an underlying Go driver, please refer to the individual driver's documentation for driver-specific information.

### Using the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper

To find all the documentation and concrete examples on how to use the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper, please refer to the [AWS Advanced Go Wrapper Documentation](./docs/Documentation.md) page.

### Known Limitations

#### Amazon RDS Blue/Green Deployments

Support for Blue/Green deployments using the AWS Advanced Go Wrapper requires specific metadata tables. The following service versions provide support for Blue/Green Deployments:

- Supported RDS PostgreSQL Versions: `rds_tools v1.7 (17.1, 16.5, 15.9, 14.14, 13.17, 12.21)` and above.
- Supported Aurora PostgreSQL Versions: Engine Release `17.5, 16.9, 15.13, 14.18, 13.21` and above.
- Supported Aurora MySQL Versions: Engine Release `3.07` and above.

Please note that Aurora Global Database and RDS Multi-AZ clusters with Blue/Green deployments are not currently supported. For detailed information on using Blue/Green and supported database versions, refer to the [Blue/Green Deployment Plugin Documentation](./docs/user-guide/using-plugins/UsingTheBlueGreenPlugin.md).
